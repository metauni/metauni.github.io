This is the seminar for everyone. Especially for new speakers and new audience members. This week's seminar is *[Alok Singh](https://twitter.com/TheRevAlokSingh)* on "Infinitely large numbers that act like they're finite" at **15:00-16:00 AEDT Thursday** (could be Wednesday where you are). To join in you'll need to install Roblox, setup voice chat (see the [Instructions](https://metauni.org/posts/instructions/instructions)) and then

Two important parts of the metauni community are sharing ideas (benefits the audience) and practicing the act of communicating ideas (benefits the speaker). To speak you *do not* have to be an expert at giving talks, and talks should mostly be “no prerequisites”. If you’re thinking “I know about this topic and I want a reason to engage with it seriously and an opportunity to practicing presenting/explaining, but I don’t really know who would be interested enough to attend and I’m not very confident in my presentation skills” then you do it at this seminar.
