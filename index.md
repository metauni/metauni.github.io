> Yet it is not these gifts, nor the most determined ambition combined with irresistible will-power, that enables one to surmount the “invisible yet formidable boundaries” that encircle our universe. Only innocence can surmount them, which mere knowledge doesn’t even take into account, in those moments when we find ourselves able to listen to things, totally and intensely absorbed in child’s play -- Alexander Grothendieck

The second metauni course [Shadows of Computation](https://metauni.org/soc/) (SOC) is **now running** and will cover introductory category theory and the relation to computer science. We recently ran a course on algebraic geometry called [MAG](https://www.metauni.org/mag). There will be a **[Festival](https://metauni.org/festival/2023/)** on the 12th of January 2023!
