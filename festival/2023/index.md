# Festival 2023

There will be a festival at [metauni](https://www.metauni.org) on the 12th of January, to celebrate metauni's second birthday. The festival will consist of

* A number of short seminar-style talks (most will be 30min) from a wide range of speakers in areas including logic, mathematics, computer science, physics, game programming, neuroscience, AI and more. 
* Meta talks on metauni, what is working and what isn't, and the future of the institution.
* General nonsense (did someone say Hilbert Ferris Wheel?).

Young presenters (e.g. undergraduate or graduate students) are particularly encouraged to speak. The goal is to have a bit of fun, learn about something from outside our own fields, and continue to figure out how to run events like this in virtual worlds.

Organisation of the event is taking place in the [metauni Discord](https://discord.gg/9yBaAxPSK8) in the channel `#festival-2023`. If you would like to give a talk (and please do) then propose a topic to speak about in the Discord channel; mentorship on giving talks is available. The first [metauni Festival](https://metauni.org/posts/festival/festival) was held in August 2021.

## Instructions

At metauni most talks are given with a tablet, writing on a board in the virtual world. You can also give a slide talk, but these will have to be sent to an organiser at least a day before to be uploaded and placed into the world. Please see the [general instructions](https://metauni.org/posts/instructions/instructions) for how to get into metauni, and the [speaker instructions](https://metauni.org/posts/instructions/instructions-admin) for more detailed information on giving a talk in the virtual environment.
