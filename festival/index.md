## Instructions for speakers

For a quick introduction to giving a talk at metauni, see [here](https://metauni.org/posts/instructions/instructions-admin). All talks will be recorded, we'll be in touch to get your permission to post them to the metauni YouTube channel (or not, it's completely up to you).

You have two options:

1. **Board talk**: you'll need a tablet that can run Roblox (or a stylus, or another way of getting similar input to a computer running Roblox, see the [instructions](https://metauni.org/posts/instructions/instructions)) and you'll give the talk by writing on boards that will be set up in the virtual world.

2. **Slide talk**: every slide for your talk will be put up in sequence in the world, and you'll present by speaking and moving between them.

If you wish to give a board talk and this is your first time doing so at metauni, you should give it a trial run beforehand. Please get in touch with me (Daniel Murfet aka `starsonthars`) on the Discord and we can run through it together in-world at a time that suits you. If you're giving a slide talk you **must prepare your sides in 4:3 format** and send them to me as PNG files labelled in the right order, **no later** than three days before the festival (Monday the 9th AEDT). Given the number of slides that need to be uploaded, and the possibility of back-and-forth required to deal with potential moderation, I can't guarantee getting your slides setup if they arrive later than that.

Please be aware that you cannot include URLs, email addresses, photos of people or small text on slides in Roblox (see the Moderation section of the [instructions](https://metauni.org/posts/instructions/instructions-admin)).
