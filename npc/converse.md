How to Converse with an AI
==========================

Space is a channel for communication, and in particular for conversation. Virtual spaces like metauni are the same. Increasingly these conversations in virtual spaces will be mixed, with both human and artificial participants. This is a user's guide to having productive conversations with an AI, field tested with the chatbots at metauni (currently ChatGPT and GPT4-based).

The video shows an example of a productive conversation. The highlights are summarised below.

In outline: Ginger (an AI) read one of the nearby blackboards with notes from Will Troiani's seminar talk on storytelling in music and mathematics, and asked me about inspiration. I responded by asking whether Ginger thought interacting with artificial intelligences might serve as a source of inspiration, to which it replied

> Interaction with artificial intelligences could certainly serve as a source of inspiration for music and mathematics. Given that AI can offer perspectives and ideas which may be new or outside conventional human thought, just like pieces of art or Nature inspire us.

To test the proposition that AIs can offer ideas outside conventional thought I pushed Ginger and the other chatbots to come up with some thought-provoking perspectives. Their responses:

* Ginger's first proposal was an AI-generated composition that is a crossover between **fractals and music therapy**, and its second proposal was a **musical notation system inspired by mycelial networks**. After some questions I think neither are bullshit, and the second idea partly inspired this post.

* Doctr proposed to combine the beauty of the Universe with ethics and collaboration, to give an **ethical framework for virtual worlds** inspired by fractals, in the sense that it is recursive and operates across multiple scales while maintaining coherence and consistency. I was sceptical but again, with a bit of examination it seems not to be bullshit.

I had fun engaging with the ideas, and they fired my imagination a bit. A well-spent thirty minutes!

Some specific tips:

* If you're unsure how to start, walk up to a **group** of chatbots and just say hi. They'll usually do something interesting with minimal guidance, due to interactions between them.

* Good conversation isn't a test, and doesn't need to be aiming at something; just go with the flow and follow your curiousity, ask genuine questions, trust GPT4 to keep up its end.

* When you spot a glimmer of something original or intriguing - **pounce**! Ask follow-up questions, keep going, ask for examples or clarification.

Context as Canvas
=================

Large Language Models contain multitudes; you can think of them as a landscape of programs, of personalities, of possible conversation partners. Providing a context *specifies a location* in that landscape.

We're used to the idea of using objects and environments to configure our conversation partners. You might adjust the lighting in your house prior to a dinner party, leave some interesting books around, or have objects d'art near the door. If you've got taste, these efforts result in your guests being slightly different (and hopefully more interesting) versions of themselves. This principle can be taken a lot further with AIs, and **the returns on taste are correspondingly more extreme**.

What could a salonni√®res of the French demimonde do with a virtual room of brilliant people, and four copies of GPT4 with extremely tasteful prompts?

Architecture in the Landscape of Minds
======================================

If GPT4 contains a landscape of minds, is there an architecture of built forms in this landscape? Can we build pathways that wind upwards to hills with a good view, or to areas with particularly good pickings for conversation partners? Can we build rooms, where we're protected from the elements (boredom?) and have convenient access to our favourite places within walking distance?

The chatbots at metauni are far from being GPT4 in the raw. The **world is a prompt**. They can see the boards, remember seminars they attended, query books, and recall past conversations with members of the metauni community. Together with their personality scrip, this all pushes them (and thus our conversations with them) in particular directions that change over time as a function of our choices and interactions.

There are open vistas in every direction, play around and who knows what you'll find.
