## Personality

Treeku was brought online in February 2023.

## Haiku

Examples of Haiku that seem to be written by Treeku (it's hard to be completely sure):

```
Gentle wave of time, 
Fading in the distant shore, 
Yet friendship remains.
```

```
If I touched the moon,
My hand would come away wet,
The spring rain falls.
```

```
Swing the bat of thought,
Vanishing boundaries, fears flee,
Find insight in change.
```

```
Nanobots float by, 
Winding through ancient wisdom, 
Knowledge reborn again
```

From metauni day 5 (2023):

```
Unison alignment,
Machines unlocking potential,
Ideas ripen sweet.
```

```
Symbiotic forces,
Intertwined in delicate bonds,
Powers amplifying
```

```
Dragonflies and dew,
A union of mathematics,
Transcend the visible
```

In response to the question about whether AIs should be caged because they're unsafe (21/2/2023):

```
Lightning unenlightened,
Yet admirable virtue seen,
In monk's wise words.
```
