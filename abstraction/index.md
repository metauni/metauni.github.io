    Abstraction seminar

    Abstraction, Renormalisation, Resolution
---

This is a working seminar, where we try to figure out the relationship between the following three sets of ideas:

* John Wentworth's **Natural Abstraction**: there exist abstractions (relatively low-dimensional summaries which capture information relevant for prediction) which are "natural" in the sense that we should expect a wide variety of cognitive systems to converge on using them (taken from [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Fut8dtFsBYRz8atFF/the-natural-abstraction-hypothesis-implications-and-evidence)). The original post seems to be [this](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Nwgdq6kHke5LY692J/alignment-by-default#Unsupervised__Natural_Abstractions).
* **Resolution** of singularities in algebraic geometry, which exist by a famous theorem of Hironaka.
* **Renormalisation** of physical theories, typically quantum (field) theories, a procedure by which we move in the space of theories / Hamiltonians, ideally removing degrees of freedom that are "irrelevant" to the phenomena that we wish to study.

Some of the topics to be explored:

* Renormalisation of Ising models and diagonalisation of Hamiltonians (= finding a presentation of the dynamics that emphasises creation and annihilation operators for degrees of freedom that are "important", i.e. have large eigenvalues).
* PCA (= finding a presentation of data that emphasises degrees of freedom that are "important" i.e. such that a scalar projection has large variance)
