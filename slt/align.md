Notes

- If alignment is possible, it has an Andersen-style quality
- Intentions may not be interpretable (the *why*), but the *how* might be
- In some limit, trajectories interacting with noise behave like particles in a supersymmetric field theory. Then to study transitions you want to group trajectories into kinds which involve rep theory
- systems coupled to noise see the jet scheme
- See more data -> simple model breaks. But how does it break?
- automated discovery of band structure
- Paradox of safety
