This is the webpage for the 2023 conference "Singularities against the Singularity" in Berkeley, CA. For further information see the [announcement](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HtxLbGvD7htCybLmZ/singularities-against-the-singularity-announcing-workshop-on) and the page for [Registration](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfehQkokQeTd9KzRRhw9QsjNB25iOuTOrEeA-V93OW0zsUnlg/viewform?usp=sf_link).


## The Primer

In the first week of the workshop we will give primers in SLT and Alignment, covering the following topics. This is a provisional list, subject to lots of change:

- **Thermodynamics** (following Callen) [ 3 hours ] Macroscopic observables, free energy, phases, phase transitions, microcanonical / canonical ensembles, Boltzmann distributions, generalised susceptibilities.
- **Catastrophe theory** (following Gilmore "Catastrophe theory for scientists and engineers") [ 2 hours ] The basics of function germs, splitting lemma, deformations plus phase transitions in Ch. 10, attempting to bridge the thermo story with the geometry store in a "hands on, I can do calculations" form (rather than "go read Hartshorne")
- **SLT high road**: [ 4 hours ] Big picture, regular vs singular, no to flatness etc., Free Energy Formula and how to use it, phase transitions, overall structure, current status (i.e. WBIC paper / green book vs gray book, open problems, what is known and unknown)
- **SLT low road**: [ 4 hours ] Some well-chosen detailed proofs, getting one's hands onto the math. Maybe going in some detail with 1-layer tanh all the way from KL divergence to the equivalent polynomial, to illustrate how the singularities arise. Maybe this includes background in Mellin transforms etc. etc.
- **Experiments**: What you need to know to run experiments (MCMC, estimating RLCTs) ? Ideally should involve releasing some preliminary library of tools on GitHub + invitation for participants to hack on it over the week
- **Intro to Alignment**:
- **Intro to Interpretability**:
